  "training.tab1.content": "<p><strong>Introduce and be someone you can rely on if children wants advice or talk</strong><br/>Most children get their first weekly pocket money at the age between 7-10 years. The weekly pocket money is normally around 20 kr at that age. When the child gets older and more mature, you can raise the weekly pocket money and after a while go over to monthly pocket money. Don’t just hand out the money. It’s important that you as a parent discuss with your children. Are they happy about their choices and how well have they spent their money?</p><p><strong>The dinner table is not wrong<br/></strong>Talking about money during dinner time is not wrong. Money should be funny and not related to anxiety when the child wants to buy something new and there is no money left. Many tough discussions between children and parents are related to money. Thats’s why you should talk about money continuous and not only when the wallet is totally empty.</p><p><strong>Negotiate with your children<br/></strong>Negotiations are important so that parents and children agree on what the money should cover from time to time. Weekly pocket money that covers a child&#8217;s purchases and at the same time gives an opportunity to save some money is recommended.</p><p><strong>When there is no more money: Say no<br/></strong>When you have agreed about the weekly and monthly pocket money, the children can take responsibility for what they can buy and what they will do with their savings. At time specific occations the children can expect their weekly or monthly pocket money. The children will therefor be able to predispose their own money and take responsibility for what they purchase. If the money runs out, the children will have to wait for their next weekly or monthly pocket money.</p><p><strong>Let your children buy the ”wrong” stuff<br/></strong>The youngest children buy candy for most of their weekly pocket money. For boys are tv- and computer games most common and for girls, make-up and clothes are most common. It’s important that, if you as a parent don’t like your child&#8217;s purcheases, you still have to allow them to buy what they want. The children have to learn to make both right and wrong choices. Making own choices is the whole idea. If you take away that part, you will prevent that children from learning, make up their own minds and find their own solutions.</p>",

Att surfplattan eller mobilen ska sända ut skadlig strålning eller göra att ett barn på något sätt får sämre inlärning är bara en myt. Det finns däremot en risk då vi låter bli att lära våra barn om digitala tjänster och plattfomar, via mobiler och läsplattor, vilket leder till barnen inte lär sig den teknik som resten av samhället har anammat.</p><p><strong>Give a chance to this new form for learning</strong><strong><br/></strong>Som föräldrar är vi ofta känslostyrda och vi människor har överlag svårt att relatera till nya saker i samhället. Att använda digitala verktyg till barnen för att underlätta vardagen ses av många som skamligt. På samma sätt som vi har skepsis mot mobiler och surfplattor har vi bemött boken och tv:n när de var nya i samhället. Men låt inte dina egna ideal av barndomen styra.</p><p><strong>Money in the phone<br/></strong>The easiest way for adults to keep control over the money is looking at the mobile. So this should be the same for children. Today, most children have their own mobile phones and have a good understanding for its use and functions. Therefore it is important that they also can handle money in their mobiles. Use apps that are understandable for children that show money its true value and the symbolism by saving and wasting.</p><p><strong>Digital purchases are also purchases<br/></strong>It’s difficult for children to understand that mobile purchases or purchases at the internet costs money too. Because they can not see any physical money is it important that you as a parent enlightens the children that mobile- or internet purchases are bought by real money. One out of ten youths says that they have bought something at the internet that they thought was free. Every second youth has at the same time bought something from the internet within the last three months.</p><p><strong>Let the digital accentuate creativity</strong><br/>Mobile phones and tablets inhibit the creativity amongst children, compared to for example Lego. This is a myth. If you take a closer look at a package from Lego, those it give you all the instructions what to do. Compare that to Minecraft for example, where there are no boundaries for what you can create with an infinite number of ”lego-pieces”. The next generation&#8217;s digital platforms will without a doubt challenge the physical worlds limitations when it comes to creativity.</p>",

  "training.tab3.content": "<p><strong>Prepare your children for the grown-up life<br/></strong>The way you can learn mathematics, balance of your mind and football is the same way that you can learn to handle your economy. A good way to lear the children about economy is to give them the liberty to questioning and think for themselves. If we during the childrens childhood give them the opportunity to make their own choices, they will be able to achieve succesful and horrible purchases. Even the bad purchases will help the children to learn and develop when it comes to economy. Maybe they will change their descions next time? Give the children the liberty to choose for themselves.</p><p><strong>Create the opportunity to earn an extra coin<br/></strong>By giving the children tasks at home and at school, they will be learning that getting money often demands some kind of effort. When the children are earning their own money, they will understand its value and a feeling of owning their own money. It can also create an companionship within the family when everybody is helping out. The children should not get paid for everything they do. They can than easily think that as soon as they do something they will be rewarded with money.</p><p><strong>Learn and play<br/></strong>To play with money and play games like Monopoly is a good way to introduce new terms and create an understanding for expenditures and revenues. Buying/selling games at home gives the children an insight with concepts like money and trade. If you have any older children they can start to invest in real or fictional companies, and create a game where you compare with the real tradning market. Compete and see who succeeds ”investing” money in the right company!</p><p><strong>Give a saving bonus<br/></strong>By giving the children an interest rate for their savings, you will increase the opportunity that they will save money. You have come a far way learning the children about moneys value if they understand that it is important to save and it will take time to achieve the amount that an expensive item costs. Let the children create their own savings goals. Let them know that saved money increases as time goes by. That is an realistic image for how the world looks today.</p><p><strong>When the money runs out<br/></strong>Sit down and have a chat with your child if there is not enough money to buy certain items. Talk about why there is to little money. Does your child get to small amounts, or does he or her spend their money to easily. Unpredicted expenditures is a matter, but if you give the child the impression that they always can get more money, they will never learn the money&#8217;s true value.</p>",

When he finally popped out of a package i bought i started crying and jumping because i was so happy. My mother asked me to run to times around the house so i could calm down.
